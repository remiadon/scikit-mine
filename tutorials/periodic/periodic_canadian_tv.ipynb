    "\n",
    "#### Handling noise in our timestamps\n",
    "\n",
    "Needless to say, it would be too easy if events in our data were equally spaced. As data often comes noisy, we have to be fault tolerant, and allow small errors to sneak into our cycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's the role of `shift corrections`, which capture the small deviations from perfectly regular periodic repetitions, and allow to reconstruct the (noisy) original sequence of events, using the following relation\n",
